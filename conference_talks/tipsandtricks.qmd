## General package development

-   Use [`dev_sitrep`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/dev_sitrep.html)
-   Ressources:
    -   https://r-pkgs.org/
    -   [Writing R extensions](https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-exts/)
    -   [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

## Quarto

-   Use `quarto preview` in terminal to open a tab that will update live when making changes to files.
    -   Configure which file changes should trigger a re-rendering by using fx. `preview: watch: - "*.qmd"` in the `_quarto.yml` file.
-   Use `pre-render` and `post-render` specified under `project` in your `_quarto.yml` file to run code prior to or after rendering the site
    -   Can fx. use `post-render` to run an R script that uses `rsync` to "move" the `_site` folder to a server location for deployment
-   Use AI to write CSS and javascript for customisation
-   Use [Quarto listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) to create overviews of the available files in a directory
-   Use `params:` at in YAML at top or documents and then reference them using `params$`
-   Use [`embed`](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html#quarto-documents) to include figures, code or anything else in code chunks from other quarto documents or Jupyter notebooks
    -   Fx. if analyses are performed which are to be used inside both an article and a slide show, save the analyses in an `analyses/` folder and just embed them from there in your other documents. Means there is one source of truth
-   Use templates        
    -   See fx. a [minimalist presentation theme for Quarto Reveal.js](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean#readme)
