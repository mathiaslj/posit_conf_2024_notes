## Use of AI

-   See section [What's new - AI tools](whats_new.qmd#sec:whats_new-AI_tools) for notes on AI tools.
-   See the [chattr R package](https://github.com/mlverse/chattr)

### Prompt engineering

-   Use single detailed prompts "built" layer by layer.
    -   Approach like designing a ggplot: Start with a plot, then layer aesthetics, geometries, facets, and limits.
-   Refer to links to help it along if you already know something about the subject, you are asking about
-   For data storytelling: Give context such as *"You are a data scientist who does a great job of explaining various outputs from data analysis and modeling, including numbers, tables, and plots, to help a more general audience understand your results better.* **Other details of model and what an inputted plot shows.** *Stick to only the data and information provided in creating your response. Your response should be understandable by a non-technical audience, 100 word or fewer, and in English.*

## General package development

-   Use [`dev_sitrep`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/dev_sitrep.html)
-   Ressources:
    -   https://r-pkgs.org/
    -   [Writing R extensions](https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-exts/)
    -   [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

## API usage

USE APIs!

-   Use [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/) for HTTP requests
-   Look into [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) API package
    -   See [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/plumber.pdf)

## Quarto

See also [What's new - Quarto](whats_new.qmd#sec:what_new-quarto).

### Tips working in Quarto

-   Use [`quarto preview`](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/text-editors.html) in terminal to open a tab that will update live when making changes to files.
    -   Configure which file changes should trigger a re-rendering by using fx. `preview: watch: - "*.qmd"` in the `_quarto.yml` file.
-   Use of [callouts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html)
    -   Create custom classes by doing `::: {.new_class} ... :::` and defining the class in the `.scss` file like `.new_class { ... }`
-   Use [Quarto listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) to create overviews of the available files in a directory
-   Use `params:` at in YAML at top or documents and then reference them using `params$`
-   Use [`embed`](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html#quarto-documents) to include figures, code or anything else in code chunks from other quarto documents or Jupyter notebooks
    -   Fx. if analyses are performed which are to be used inside both an article and a slide show, save the analyses in an `analyses/` folder and just embed them from there in your other documents. Means there is one source of truth
-   Can ctrl+V images in visual mode

### Formats

Use templates!

-   [Revealjs for presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
    -   See fx. a [minimalist presentation theme for Quarto Reveal.js](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean#readme)
    -   See also [Quarto revealjs presentation theme generator](https://github.com/melissavanbussel/theme-generator)
-   Website for personal note taking: [Quarto wiki template](https://github.com/cynthiahqy/quarto-wiki-template) to create a Quarto website to host research notes, articles, glossaries, etc.
-   Website with a blog: [Repo for Cynthia Huang's personal website](https://github.com/cynthiahqy/digital-garden)
-   [`format: manuscript`](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/) for research notes
    -   Similar to website but can be tied up to journal templates

### Publishing

-   Use existing GitHub actions
    -   See fx. the [build_book.yaml](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_book.yaml) action in R for data science.
    -   See [general quarto actions by quarto_dev](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions)
-   Use `pre-render` and `post-render` specified under `project` in your `_quarto.yml` file to run code prior to or after rendering the site
    -   Can fx. use `post-render` to run an R script that uses `rsync` to "move" the `_site` folder to a server location for deployment

### Customisation

-   Use CSS and javascript for customisation
    -   [Mozilla web docs for help with fx. CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
    -   Use AI to help write CSS and javascript
    -   Use [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) via right-click -> inspect to look at the HTML
        -   Make changes to see how it affects the website
        -   Can be used on resulting HTMLs from rendering of quarto to help see structure and aid in writing of CSS to style
        -   See how other people's websites are structured

### Miscellaneous other notes

-   `_common.R` file in project that sets `options(...)`, `knitr::opts_chunk$set(...)`, [theme_set](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme_get.html) and [update_geom_defaults](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/update_defaults.html) 
-   Look into [execution management with freeze(:auto)](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze)
-   Use of javascript extensions [lightbox](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-lightbox-figures.html) (allows reader to click image to enlarge) and [masonry](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-masonry) (grid layout library for customisation of image placements)

## Positron

-   Documentation on hover
-   Use Poistron to debug C and C++
-   Ctrl+shift+P opens command palette
-   "Enable Rstudio key mappings in Positron" setting available
-   Extensions readily available from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/)
    -   [Continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) for AI code assistant

### Computational statistics

Think of computational statistics as way of having *only one test* contrary to theoretical statistic, where need to think about what is the "right" distribution or test
