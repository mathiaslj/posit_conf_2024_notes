### Session description

*Cynthia Huang explores the versatility of Quarto for knowledge management and note-taking, sharing her experience using Quarto websites to track PhD progress, document insights from conferences, and manage collaborative research projects. This session demonstrates how to implement standard knowledge management features such as cross-referencing, search indexing, and custom navigation within Quarto. Cynthia also delves into more advanced features like glossaries, document listings, and dataset summaries, showing how Quartoâ€™s flexibility can meet diverse needs. Whether you are new to Quarto or an experienced user, this talk will inspire you to consider Quarto for your own knowledge management system.*

### Session notes

See Cynthia's [Quarto wiki template](https://github.com/cynthiahqy/quarto-wiki-template) to create a Quarto website to host research notes, articles, glossaries, etc.

See Cynthia's [repo for her personal website](https://github.com/cynthiahqy/digital-garden)

**Essence of talk:** Have all notes from research gathered in one place, so everything is searchable and reusable.

-   Use [Quarto listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) to create overviews of fx. definitions of terms withing different research fields
-   Tip: Can ctrl+V images in visual mode
-   Use of javascript extensions [lightbox](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-lightbox-figures.html) (allows reader to click image to enlarge) and [masonry](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-masonry) (grid layout library for customisation of image placements)
-   [`format: manuscript`](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/) for research notes
    -   Similar to website but can be tied up to journal templates

#### Separate repo with images

Cynthia has a [separate repo with images](https://github.com/cynthiahqy/collection_crossmap-images) that are used across projects, so they are in a central location where they are easily found

-   Readme is constructed to show all images and where they can be found
