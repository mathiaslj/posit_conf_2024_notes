## Quarto

-   [typst](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html) for PDF creation with exact look of HTML. 
-   [Quarto live](https://github.com/r-wasm/quarto-live) for interactive documents and code exercises to create educational content.
    
## Data access and user authentication

-   Ability to sign into organisation's cloud data platform like [snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) or [databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) in Posit Workbench AND Posit Connect
    -   Users no longer have to think about managing access tokens to pass them to connections when working in workbench
    -   Authentication for data access in deployed Shiny apps in Posit Connect is automatic with a simple login to the cloud data platform
